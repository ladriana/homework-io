## I/O Homework

Open a stream from a URL where you find text, such as:

https://gist.githubusercontent.com/phillipj/4944029/raw/75ba2243dd5ec2875f629bf5d79f6c1e4b5a8b46/alice_in_wonderland.txt

    Read the URL as user input.

    You will use the java.net.URL class. Read about it here: 
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URL.html

    Pay attention to the openStream() method.


    Read the contents on the remote resource as text (line by line).
    Write the information to a new text file, at a location on disk specified by the user.
Each line of text will have at the beginning a number. This number represents the number of words on that line.
